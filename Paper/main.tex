% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
    Emergency speech recognition systems exhibit systematic performance degradation on non-standard English varieties, creating a critical gap in services for Caribbean populations. We present TRIDENT (Triage via Dual-stream Emergency Natural language and Tone), a three-layer triage architecture designed for resilience when automatic speech recognition fails. The system combines Caribbean-accent-tuned ASR, local entity extraction via large language models, and bio-acoustic distress detection to route emergency calls based on transcription confidence, semantic content severity, and vocal stress indicators. \textbf{Our key insight is that low ASR confidence, rather than representing system failure, serves as a valuable triage signal---particularly when combined with elevated vocal distress markers indicating a caller in crisis whose speech may have shifted toward basilectal registers.} A complementary insight drives the content severity layer: trained responders and composed bystanders may report life-threatening emergencies without elevated vocal stress, requiring semantic analysis to capture urgency that paralinguistic features miss. We describe the architectural design, theoretical grounding in psycholinguistic research on stress-induced code-switching, and deployment considerations for offline operation during disaster scenarios. \textbf{This paper presents an architectural framework and position paper; empirical validation on Caribbean emergency calls remains future work.} This work establishes a framework for accent-resilient emergency AI that treats dialect variation as a routing feature rather than a transcription bug.
