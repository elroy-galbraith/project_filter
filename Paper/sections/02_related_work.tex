\section{Related Work}

The proposed crisis triage system draws on and extends research across four domains: automatic speech recognition for accented and low-resource speech varieties, artificial intelligence in emergency dispatch, vocal stress detection, and edge computing for disaster resilience. We review each in turn, identifying the gaps that motivate our three-layer architecture.
