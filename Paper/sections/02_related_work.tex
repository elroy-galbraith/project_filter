\section{Related Work}

The proposed dispatcher-support architecture draws on and extends research across five domains: ASR for accented and low-resource speech varieties, artificial intelligence (AI) in emergency dispatch (including the clinical triage protocols AI systems must support), vocal stress detection, dialect reversion under cognitive load, and edge computing for disaster resilience. We review each in turn, identifying the gaps that motivate TRIDENT's three-layer design.
