\section{System Architecture}

TRIDENT implements a three-layer architecture where each component provides independent value while contributing to a unified triage decision. Figure~\ref{fig:system_diagram} illustrates the system flow.

\caption{The TRIDENT architecture. The system processes raw audio through two parallel streams: (Left) A Caribbean-adapted ASR and NLP pipeline for semantic extraction and content severity scoring, and (Right) a bio-acoustic analysis layer for determining physiological distress. The Triage Decision Engine integrates three independent signals---ASR confidence, content severity, and vocal distress---ensuring that (1) calls with low transcription confidence but high vocal distress are routed to priority dispatch, and (2) semantically urgent calls from calm reporters are not under-prioritized due to absent vocal stress markers.}
