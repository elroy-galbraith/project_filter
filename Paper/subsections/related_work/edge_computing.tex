\subsection{Edge Computing for Disaster Resilience}

Infrastructure failure during disasters makes the case for offline-capable emergency AI. Hurricane Maria's impact on Puerto Rico saw 95\% of cell towers fail, with the entire island losing power \cite{santosburgoa2020}. Communication infrastructure failure contributed to a disputed death toll ultimately estimated at approximately 3,000, with recovery requiring over 200 days for full power restoration.

Recent model compression advances make edge deployment feasible. Pre-positioned edge computing resources at hospitals, shelters, and emergency coordination centers, loaded with Caribbean-tuned models, could maintain triage capability even during complete grid and network failure.
