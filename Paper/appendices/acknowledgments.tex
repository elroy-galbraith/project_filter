This work emerged from the Caribbean Voices AI Hackathon, organized by the UWI AI Innovation Centre and hosted on Zindi. We thank sponsors CIBC, Infolytics, and DataAxis for their support. The competition's BBC Caribbean speech corpus motivated this architectural framework. We also thank Dr. Sikopo Nyambe-Galbraith for feedback on the research.

We also acknowledge the use of Google's Gemini 3.0 Pro when brainstorming the ideas for the paper, conducting deep research, and the generation of the figures in this paper. Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.5 was used for the editing and proofreading of the paper.
