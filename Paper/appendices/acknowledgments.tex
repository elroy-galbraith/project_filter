This work emerged from the Caribbean Voices AI Hackathon, organized by the UWI AI Innovation Centre and hosted on Zindi as part of the Caribbean Information and Youth Network (CIYN), a strategic initiative of the Caribbean Telecommunications Union (CTU). We thank the sponsors—CIBC, Infolytics, and DataAxis—for their support. The competition's BBC Caribbean speech corpus (28,000 clips) motivated this architectural framework, though we note that TRIDENT is presented as a position paper; the organizers retain rights to fine-tuned models from the competition. We also thank Dr. Sikopo Nyambe-Galbraith for feedback on the research.
